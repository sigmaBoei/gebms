GYM EQUIPMENT BORROWING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Gym Equipment Borrowing and Management System shall facilitate students, faculty, and personnels with an effective gym equipment borrowing and return process. The primary goal is to design, develop, and implement a gym equipment borrowing management system. Furthermore, it entails support and maintenance, the training of staff on the usage of the system, and the implementation of user roles with varying levels of access and privileges. A database will be provided that includes all the equipment in the gym, complete with descriptions, images, and details of whether it is available or not. Also, the system will offer an alternative to move along the reservations of equipment with duration and pickup time to be specified.
